 I am currently a master's student in Artificial Intelligence in the [Department of Computer and Systems Sciences](https://www.su.se/department-of-computer-and-systems-sciences/) at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/cmlink/stockholm-university) (SU). Previously to joining SU, I obtained a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a specialization in Computing at the [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/en/), Spain, and graduated 1st in my promotion (class of 2022). I spent the last six months of my major at the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) conducting my final thesis on detecting polyps in colonoscopy images using Convolutional Neural Networks. 

My interests lie in the fields of databases and machine learning systems. They include data management, scalable data analysis, query processing, optimization for machine learning systems, and graph analysis. I aspire to work on developing software tools to create large-scale and efficient data processing pipelines with applications to social science, healthcare, finance, and beyond. I am looking for job opportunities and contemplating research groups to pursue a Ph.D. along this research line. Moreover, I greatly enjoy helping other students. You can find more in my notes. 


In my free time, I enjoy working out and doing outdoor activities (hiking, skiing, swimming). I also dance bachata and salsa with a group of ladies. However, what I like the most is spending time with my cat Joia.  

Feel free to contact me by email if you want to get in touch or have any questions. I will do my best to help.
