I am a Software Engineer with a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the [Department of Computer and Systems Sciences](https://www.su.se/department-of-computer-and-systems-sciences/) at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/cmlink/stockholm-university) (SU). During my graduate studies, I worked on a collaborative project with Spotify about Explainability in AI for ranking models.
 
Previously to joining SU, I obtained a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a specialization in Computing at the [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/en/), Spain, and graduated first in my class (class of 2022). I spent the final six months of my degree program at the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) conducting my final thesis on detecting polyps in colonoscopy images using Convolutional Neural Networks. 

My interests lie in the fields of databases and machine learning systems. They include data management, scalable data analysis, query processing, optimization for machine learning systems, and graph analysis. I aspire to work on developing software tools to create large-scale and efficient data processing pipelines. I am looking for job opportunities along this line.

In my free time, I enjoy working out and doing outdoor activities (hiking, skiing, swimming). I also dance bachata and play guitar. However, what I like the most is spending time with my cat [Joia](https://lauragalera.github.io/personal/joia).  

Feel free to contact me on Linkedin if you want to get in touch.
