I am a Data Engineer at [Edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/), focused on designing, maintaining, and optimizing our AWS-based data system. Beyond constructing ETL pipelines, my role extends to orchestrating our data lake housing and ensuring seamless integration with multiple databases, utilizing AWS services such as S3, Glue, and Redshift.
 
Previously to joining Edpuzzle, I earned an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/cmlink/stockholm-university) and collaborated with Spotify on Explainability in AI for ranking models. I also obtained a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a specialization in Computing from the [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/en/), and spent six months at the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) conducting my final thesis on Convolutional Neural Networks. 

My interests lie in the fields of databases and machine learning systems. They include data management, scalable data analysis, query processing, optimization for machine learning systems, and graph analysis.

In my free time, I enjoy working out and doing outdoor activities (hiking, skiing, swimming). I also dance bachata and play guitar. However, what I like the most is spending time with my cat [Joia](https://lauragalera.github.io/personal/joia).  

Feel free to contact me on Linkedin if you want to get in touch.
