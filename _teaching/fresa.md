Hi, my name is Fresa (Strawberry). Glamorous, right? However, I go by "Fresa" only in public because Laura would be too embarrassed if someone knew all the corny names she calls me by when we're alone.

I was born on October 22nd 2022, after my abandoned mum was rescued. A total of five newborn kittens. All siamese except my brother who spent too much time in the making and came out burnt. We were so adorable that everybody wanted to meet us, but Laura was the first to come, and she immediately fell in love with me.

When I was two months old, I moved to Laura's house where I've been living my best life eating yummy food, chasing birds, and taking long *siestas*.
